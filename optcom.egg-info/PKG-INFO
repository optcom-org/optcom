Description: # Optcom
        > Optical system simulation software.
        
        Optcom is a library which aims to simulate optical systems with an emphasis on optical communnication systems. Optcom has been created with the following objectiv in mind:
        * Be able to create a non sequential and non directional optical system by assembling individual components.
        * Be able to choose the set of equations used for the simulation of a component as well as the solver type.
        * Be able to deal with ultra-short pulses. (~ fs)
        * Be able to create a new component for python beginners.
